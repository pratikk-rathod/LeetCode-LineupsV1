## <span style="color:#39ff14;text-shadow:0 0 8px #39ff14;">📘 Problem Statement</span>
2092. Find All People With SecretSolvedHardTopicsCompaniesHintYou are given an integer n indicating there are n people numbered from 0 to n - 1. You are also given a 0-indexed 2D integer array meetings where meetings[i] = [xi, yi, timei] indicates that person xi and person yi have a meeting at timei. A person may attend multiple meetings at the same time. Finally, you are given an integer firstPerson.

Person 0 has a secret and initially shares the secret with a person firstPerson at time 0. This secret is then shared every time a meeting takes place with a person that has the secret. More formally, for every meeting, if a person xi has the secret at timei, then they will share the secret with person yi, and vice versa.

The secrets are shared instantaneously. That is, a person may receive the secret and share it with people in other meetings within the same time frame.

Return a list of all the people that have the secret after all the meetings have taken place. You may return the answer in any order.

 
Example 1:

Input: n = 6, meetings = [[1,2,5],[2,3,8],[1,5,10]], firstPerson = 1
Output: [0,1,2,3,5]
Explanation:
At time 0, person 0 shares the secret with person 1.
At time 5, person 1 shares the secret with person 2.
At time 8, person 2 shares the secret with person 3.
At time 10, person 1 shares the secret with person 5.​​​​
Thus, people 0, 1, 2, 3, and 5 know the secret after all the meetings.


Example 2:

Input: n = 4, meetings = [[3,1,3],[1,2,2],[0,3,3]], firstPerson = 3
Output: [0,1,3]
Explanation:
At time 0, person 0 shares the secret with person 3.
At time 2, neither person 1 nor person 2 know the secret.
At time 3, person 3 shares the secret with person 0 and person 1.
Thus, people 0, 1, and 3 know the secret after all the meetings.


Example 3:

Input: n = 5, meetings = [[3,4,2],[1,2,1],[2,3,1]], firstPerson = 1
Output: [0,1,2,3,4]
Explanation:
At time 0, person 0 shares the secret with person 1.
At time 1, person 1 shares the secret with person 2, and person 2 shares the secret with person 3.
Note that person 2 can share the secret at the same time as receiving it.
At time 2, person 3 shares the secret with person 4.
Thus, people 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 know the secret after all the meetings.


 
Constraints:


	2 <= n <= 105
	1 <= meetings.length <= 105
	meetings[i].length == 3
	0 <= xi, yi <= n - 1
	xi != yi
	1 <= timei <= 105
	1 <= firstPerson <= n - 1

```python
class Solution:
    def findAllPeople(self, n, meetings, firstPerson):
        parent = list(range(n))

        def find(x):
            if parent[x] != x:
                parent[x] = find(parent[x])
            return parent[x]

        def union(a, b):
            parent[find(b)] = find(a)

        meetings.sort(key=lambda x: x[2])

        union(0, firstPerson)

        i = 0
        while i < len(meetings):
            time = meetings[i][2]
            involved = []

            while i < len(meetings) and meetings[i][2] == time:
                x, y, _ = meetings[i]
                union(x, y)
                involved.append(x)
                involved.append(y)
                i += 1

            root0 = find(0)
            for p in involved:
                if find(p) != root0:
                    parent[p] = p

        return [i for i in range(n) if find(i) == find(0)]
