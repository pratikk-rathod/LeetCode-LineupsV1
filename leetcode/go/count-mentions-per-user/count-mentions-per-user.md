3433. Count Mentions Per UserSolvedMediumTopicsCompaniesHintYou are given an integer numberOfUsers representing the total number of users and an array events of size n x 3.

Each events[i] can be either of the following two types:


	Message Event: ["MESSAGE", "timestampi", "mentions_stringi"]

	
		This event indicates that a set of users was mentioned in a message at timestampi.
		The mentions_stringi string can contain one of the following tokens:
		
			id<number>: where <number> is an integer in range [0,numberOfUsers - 1]. There can be multiple ids separated by a single whitespace and may contain duplicates. This can mention even the offline users.
			ALL: mentions all users.
			HERE: mentions all online users.
		
		
	
	
	Offline Event: ["OFFLINE", "timestampi", "idi"]
	
		This event indicates that the user idi had become offline at timestampi for 60 time units. The user will automatically be online again at time timestampi + 60.
	
	


Return an array mentions where mentions[i] represents the number of mentions the user with id i has across all MESSAGE events.

All users are initially online, and if a user goes offline or comes back online, their status change is processed before handling any message event that occurs at the same timestamp.

Note that a user can be mentioned multiple times in a single message event, and each mention should be counted separately.

 
Example 1:


Input: numberOfUsers = 2, events = [["MESSAGE","10","id1 id0"],["OFFLINE","11","0"],["MESSAGE","71","HERE"]]

Output: [2,2]

Explanation:

Initially, all users are online.

At timestamp 10, id1 and id0 are mentioned. mentions = [1,1]

At timestamp 11, id0 goes offline.

At timestamp 71, id0 comes back online and "HERE" is mentioned. mentions = [2,2]


Example 2:


Input: numberOfUsers = 2, events = [["MESSAGE","10","id1 id0"],["OFFLINE","11","0"],["MESSAGE","12","ALL"]]

Output: [2,2]

Explanation:

Initially, all users are online.

At timestamp 10, id1 and id0 are mentioned. mentions = [1,1]

At timestamp 11, id0 goes offline.

At timestamp 12, "ALL" is mentioned. This includes offline users, so both id0 and id1 are mentioned. mentions = [2,2]


Example 3:


Input: numberOfUsers = 2, events = [["OFFLINE","10","0"],["MESSAGE","12","HERE"]]

Output: [0,1]

Explanation:

Initially, all users are online.

At timestamp 10, id0 goes offline.

At timestamp 12, "HERE" is mentioned. Because id0 is still offline, they will not be mentioned. mentions = [0,1]


 
Constraints:


	1 <= numberOfUsers <= 100
	1 <= events.length <= 100
	events[i].length == 3
	events[i][0] will be one of MESSAGE or OFFLINE.
	1 <= int(events[i][1]) <= 105
	The number of id<number> mentions in any "MESSAGE" event is between 1 and 100.
	0 <= <number> <= numberOfUsers - 1
	It is guaranteed that the user id referenced in the OFFLINE event is online at the time the event occurs.

class Solution:
    def countMentions(self, numberOfUsers: int, events: List[List[str]]) -> List[int]:
        events.sort(key=lambda x: (int(x[1]), x[0] == "MESSAGE"))
        off = deque()
        point_c = [0] * numberOfUsers
        all_c = 0
        on_c = 0
        for m, t, ids in events:
            t = int(t)
            while off and off[0][0] <= t:
                _, id, l_on = off.popleft() 
                point_c[id] -= on_c - l_on

            if m == "MESSAGE":
                for id in ids.split(' '):
                    if id == "HERE":
                        on_c += 1
                    elif id == "ALL":
                        all_c += 1
                    else:
                        point_c[int(id[2:])] += 1
            else:
                off.append((t+60, int(ids), on_c))
        
        while off:
            _, id, l_on = off.popleft() 
            point_c[id] -= on_c - l_on
        return [c + all_c + on_c for c in point_c]
